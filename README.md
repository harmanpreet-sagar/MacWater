# MacWater

## Inspiration
60% of McMaster University students still use plastic water bottles as water filter systems all across campus remain yellow or red for a very long time. To save students the time of finding a working filter, we have created a web app that enables McMaster's audience to view the status of each water filter on campus.

## What it does
Enable McMaster students to easily access real-time updates on the status of water filtration systems across campus.

## How we built it
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- SQL
- Node.js
- TensorFlow

## Figma Prototype UI
[Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/h620v18JOyDhul43kruTRh/MacWater?type=design&node-id=35-638&t=ti5GcqU8MmHDnEdn-1&scaling=scale-down-width&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=35%3A635&mode=design)

## Challenges we ran into
- Creating the image classifier system
- Loading the image classifier system
- Improving Accuracy 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Working with TensorFlow for the first time and being able to implement an ML model to detect the colour of the sensor

## What we learned
- Image classification applications in machine learning
- TensorFlow 

## What's next for MacWater
- Improving UI
- Incorporating feedback
- Switch from SQL to Firebase
- Update the filter status as assessed by the model to the database
